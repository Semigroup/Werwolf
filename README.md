# Werwolf
A C# desktop application for creating card games in German language.

This appclication offers suitable templates for social deduction games (like Werwolf)
and for card sets for tabletop-roleplaying games.
However, it can also be used for cards for other kind of games.

This software has a user-friendly interface for simple operations
but also allows for complex designs and layout changes.
You can create games, create cards, compose decks and print your decks directly to pdf, which are ready to be printed.
Alternatively, you can directly render your cards tom image files of arbitrarily high resolution.

When changing properties of cards (name, rules text, layout, background image, ...) those changes will be directly
rendered, which allows for precise and fine-grained design operations.

Both examples look better when used with more suitable fonts (like Exocet or the Beleren font of MtG).

## Usage
To use the software just unpack the release and start
WerwolfProgram.exe directly.
